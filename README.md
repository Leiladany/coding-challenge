## Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: A fast build tool and development server that enhances development efficiency with instant hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds.

## Why Vite?

Vite provides a fast development server that reflects changes immediately in the browser. It also ensures that our final bundles are compact and performant. It supports ES modules and on-demand compilation. All of this allows me to focus more on coding.

## Usage
